Method Overriding:
    Allows us to have same name methods in parent and child classes.
Why we should Override a method:
    Lets say we are inheriting from a Parent class that has 10 methods. We like 8 of them. We want to keep methods
    but we don't like 2 of them we want to provide implementation in a differnt way.
