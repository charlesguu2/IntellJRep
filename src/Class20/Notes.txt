What is Inheritance:
     It's a mechanism through which a class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.
Why we should inheritance:
     It helps us avoid code duplication.
     It helps us save space.
     It helps us improve the execution speed.
What is the syntax:
     We use the "extends" keyword and the name of the class from which we want to inherit the fields
     and methods while declaring the class.
Types of inheritance:
     There can be 4 types of inheritance, but Java only supports 3 of them in classes.
     1)Single
     2)Multilevel
     3)Hierarchical
     4)Multiple(not supported by classes in java).
Single inheritance:
     When we have only one parent and one child classes in inheritance it is called single inheritance.
     not widely used.
Multilevel inheritance:
     One top level and one base class and many intermediate classes. For example A<B<C<D
Hierarchical inheritance:
     When we have one parent class and multiple child classes it's called Hierarchical Inheritance.
Multiple inheritance:
     One child and multiple parent classes. It is not supported by classes in java.
Super keyword:
     We use the super keyword to explicitly call the variable from the parent class. When we have same name instance
     variable in child class and parent class.
     We can also use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class.

MethodOverloading:
     Method overloading allows us to create multiple methods in a class with the same name.
Why we should create multiple methods with same name?
     It gives the end user flexibility.
     The end user can call the same method with different parameters to get same or different results.
How do we overload a method?
     1)By passing different number of parameters.
     2)By changing datatype.
     3)By changing sequence of parameters.
