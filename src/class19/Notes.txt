"this" keyword:
   "this" is a keyword like "class", "void". It is used in many places. For example
   if we have same name instance and a local variable we can use "this" explicitly
   refer to instance variable. We can use "this()" to call a constructor.
Why should we learn about "this" keyword:
   1)it allows us to have same name local and instance variables.
   2)if we have same code in two constructors we can reuse that code from one constructor
   inside another constructor by writing "this()".
Inheritance:
   Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can use the fields/methods of one
   class inside another class.
   There are 4 types of inheritance.
   1)Single Inheritance:
      In single inheritance we have only one parent and one child class.
      Employee-->Person
   2)Multilevel Inheritance:
      In Multilevel inheritance we have inheritance in multiple levels like we have grandfather->father->son->grandson
   3)Hierarchical Inheritance:
      One parent class and multiple direct child classes.
   4)Multiple Inheritance:
   one child class a directly inherit from multiple parent classes. It is not supported by java because of diamond problem
Why we should learn Inheritance:
   it allows to reduce the duplicate code.
What is the syntax:
   we can use this feature by writing keyword "extends" after class name.
