Types of variables in Java with respect to their scope:
    There are three types of variables in java with respect to their
    scope.  Local, instance, and static.

Local variables:
   If a variable is declares inside a block of code like method, loop,
   if-condition they are called local variables.
Positives of a local variable:
   The upside is they exist for a very short amount of time in the memory.
   which means other programs on our computer can use that memory.
Negatives of a local variable:
    Their scope is very limited. only inside that block in which they are created.
    we cant access them outside that block.
When to use:
    We should always try to use local variable over instance variables whenever it
    is possible.

Instance variables:
    The variable which are declared inside a class but outside of block of code are
    calls instance variables.
Positives of a instance variable:
    We can use these variables inside any block of code that us inside that class.
Negatives of a instance variable:
    They occupy the memory for longer than a local variable
When to use:
    1)When we need to share a value between 2 or more methods, then we should go with instance variable.
    2)When we are planning to create multiple objects of a class, and it is possible that all the objects can have
    a different value for that variable.

Static variable:
    An instance variable with static keyword is called a static variable.
Positives of a static variable:
    We can share data across the objects with the help of static variable.
Negatives of static variables:
    They occupy the memory for the longest period.
When to use:
    When we want to share something across all the methods.

Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords which control the access of fields or methods or the class itself
    There are four access levels and three access modifier keywords. These are only applicable to instance
    or static variables, not to local variables.
Keyword Private:
    Private is the most restricted one. If we use private keyword with any variable or method. We can only
    access it within the same class.
When to use:
     We should always try to create variables as private.
Positives:
     The data that we insert inside our private variable is secured.

Default access modifier:
     Default is not a keyword. Whenever we don't assign any access modifier keyword like private,
     public, protected. Java assigns access level to those variables or methods.
     The variables or methods which have default access level can be accessed within the same class or in any other class
     that is present inside the same package.

Public access modifier:
     Public access most unrestricted access modifier. Once used with a variable or
